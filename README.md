# Multiclass_Fish_Image_Classification

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and deploying a Multiclass Fish Image Classification system using deep learning. The goal is to classify fish images into multiple categories using both a custom CNN model and transfer learning with pre-trained models.

The project also demonstrates how to:

Preprocess and augment image data.

Train, evaluate, and compare multiple deep learning models.

Deploy a Streamlit web app that predicts the fish category from user-uploaded images.

💼 Business Use Cases

🎯 Enhanced Accuracy: Determine the best architecture for fish image classification.

⚙️ Deployment Ready: Build a user-friendly web app for real-time predictions.

📊 Model Comparison: Evaluate models and select the best-performing one for production.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how transfer learning significantly boosts performance in image classification tasks. By integrating deep learning, data preprocessing, and deployment, it forms a complete end-to-end ML pipeline for real-world applications.
